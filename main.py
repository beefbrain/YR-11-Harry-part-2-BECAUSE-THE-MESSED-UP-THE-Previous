# the keys in the the dictionary char_score is the same to the value of all of the sets. i need to use a for loop to link them as the for loop will check the dictionary keys one after the other.

  #print(character)
#i am printing to test if characters holds the correct values
  char_score[character] +=1
print (char_score)
